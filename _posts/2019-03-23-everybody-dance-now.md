**Abstract:** This paper presents a simple method for "do as I do" motion transfer: given a source video of a person dancing we can transfer that performance to a novel (amateur) target after only a few minutes of the target subject performing standard moves. We pose this problem as a per-frame image-to-image translation with spatio-temporal smoothing. Using pose detections as an intermediate representation between source and target, we learn a mapping from pose images to a target subject's appearance. We adapt this setup for temporally coherent video generation including realistic face synthesis.

**Note:** Implementation of this paper will need collection of your own video data according to the specifications. It will also need the knowledge and implementation of multiple components (Image to Image Translation, Pose Estimation, GANs etc.). Attempt this paper only if you are REALLY interested and willing to invest time.
