A pseudo-parallel chaotic genetic algorithm is presented in this paper. The proposed algorithm is established by using the pseudo-random property of chaotic sequence and putting chaos into a pseudo-parallel genetic algorithm. The calculating results of three testing functions demonstrate that the both of the premature phenomenon and the slow convergence in conventional standard genetic algorithm can be prominently improved with the algorithm, and the presented algorithm is also superior to the pseudo-parallel genetic algorithms in the aspect of avoiding premature.
