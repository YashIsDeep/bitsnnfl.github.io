Automatic generation of paraphrases from a given sentence is an important yet challenging task in natural language processing (NLP).This paper proposes a new model that allows for training multiple stacked LSTM networks by introducing a residual connection between the layers.This is inspired by the recent success of such connections in a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the image recognition task.
