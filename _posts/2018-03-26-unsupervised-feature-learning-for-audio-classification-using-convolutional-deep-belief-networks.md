**Abstract:** In recent years, deep learning approaches have gained significant interest as a

way of building hierarchical representations from unlabeled data. However, to

our knowledge, these deep learning approaches have not been extensively studied

for auditory data. In this paper, we apply convolutional deep belief networks

to audio data and empirically evaluate them on various audio classification

tasks. In the case of speech data, we show that the learned features correspond to

phones/phonemes. In addition, our feature representations learned from unlabeled

audio data show very good performance for multiple audio classification tasks.

We hope that this paper will inspire more research on deep learning approaches

applied to a wide range of audio recognition tasks.
