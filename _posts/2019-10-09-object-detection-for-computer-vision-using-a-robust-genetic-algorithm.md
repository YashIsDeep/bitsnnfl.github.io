**Abstract:** This work is concerned with the development and implementation of an image pattern recognition approach to support computational vision systems when it is necessary to automatically check the presence of specific objects on a scene, and, besides, to describe their position, orientation and scale. The developed methodology involves the use of a genetic algorithm to find known 2D object views in the image. The proposed approach is fast and presented a robust performance in several test instances including multiobject scenes, with or without partial occlusion.

**ID:** 203

**Guidelines:**

1. Read through the paper, understand the problem statement and why it is NP-complete.
2. Implement the entire algorithm from in Python.
3. Create your own dataset, similar to the one in the paper, using common objects like water bottles or stationary.
4. Do a qualitative comparison on the performance of different genetic operators by performing experiments on the dataset.
