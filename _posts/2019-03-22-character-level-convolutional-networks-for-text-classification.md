**Abstract:** This article offers an empirical exploration on the use of character-level convolutional networks (ConvNets) for text classification. We constructed several largescale datasets to show that character-level convolutional networks could achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results. Comparisons are offered against traditional models such as bag of words, n-grams and their TFIDF variants, and deep learning models such as word-based ConvNets and recurrent neural networks.

**Paper ID: 51**

**Guidelines:**  Implement the CNN based model, also compare it with traditional NLP approaches like bag of words and tf-idf.
