A new design of a music note recognition system based on time delay neural networks, self organizing maps, and linear vector quantization is proposed in this paper, and the general designs of two possible applications based on this system are illustrated.  In this paper, a more efficient system is proposed for music note recognition. The proposed system uses time delay neural networks (TDNN), self organizing maps (SOM) and linear vector quantization (LVQ) in a combinative architecture that is able to recognize the seven basic pitches of music notes in the octave between 220Hz and 392Hz. It is also illustrated in this paper that the proposed note recognition system can be used as a main block in some important applications, especially those related to multimedia and music industry.
