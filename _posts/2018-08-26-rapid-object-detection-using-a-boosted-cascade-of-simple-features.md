Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features  - one of the most-cited and classic papers in computer vision, the Viola–Jones object detection framework is the first object detection framework to provide competitive object detection rates in real-time proposed in 2001 by Paul Viola and Michael Jones. Although it can be trained to detect a variety of object classes, it was motivated primarily by the problem of face detection.

This paper brings together new algorithms and insights to construct a framework for robust and extremely rapid object detection. This technique was further improved and patented by Fujifilm and used for the face detection software that was utilised in their cameras in the year 2006.
