This paper mainly talks about the Recurrent Neural Network and introduces a more effective neural network model named LSTM. Then, the paper recommends a special language model based on Recurrent Neural Network. With the help of LSTM and RNN language models, program can predict the next character after a certain character. The main purpose of this paper is to compare the LSTM model with the standard RNN model and see their results in character prediction. So we can see the huge potential of Recurrent Neural Network Language Model in the field of character prediction.
