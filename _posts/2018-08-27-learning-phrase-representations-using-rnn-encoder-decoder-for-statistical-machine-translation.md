In  this  paper,   a  novel  neural network model called RNN Encoder–Decoder is proposed  that  consists  of  two  recurrent neural  networks  (RNN).  One  RNN  encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixed-length vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols.  The encoder and decoder  of  the  proposed  model  are  jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence.   The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder–Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model.    Qualitatively,  we  show  that  the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases.
