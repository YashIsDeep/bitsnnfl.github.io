Sentiment Analysis is the computational study of people's opinions,sentiments and emotions towards others.With the rapid development of Internet and big explosion of text data, it has been a very significant research subject to extract valuable information from text ocean of reviews,blogs etc.  To realize multi-classification for text sentiment, this paper promotes a RNN language model based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), which can get complete sequence information effectively. Compared with the traditional RNN language model, LSTM is better in analyzing emotion of long sentences. And as a language model, LSTM is applied to achieve multi-classification for text emotional attributes.
