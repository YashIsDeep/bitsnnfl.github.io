Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has been demonstrated to be a useful technique in robot path planning in dynamic environment with mobile obstacles and goal. One or many robots are able to locate a specification target with high efficiency when driven by an optimization PSO algorithm. The goal of the optimization is minimize the resultant path lengths. To avoid obstacles during movement trajectory, self organized trajectory planning is required. This study propose to use particle swarm optimization, which is motivate from the simulation of social behavior of fishes and birds, as a feasible approach for self organized control of robot to avoid obstacle throughout the trajectory.
