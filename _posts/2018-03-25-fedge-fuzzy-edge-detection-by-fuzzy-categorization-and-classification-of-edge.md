**Abstract:**  In this paper we will present a fuzzy edge detector, FEDGE. It is based on learning fuzzy edges by the method of Fuzzy Categorization and Classification (FCC). A set of images were used as examples for the definition of a fuzzy edge. FCC will try to recognize edges within a new image by collecting evidence from these examples. FEDGE demonstrates that FCC can be used homogeneously from pixel-level to symbolic level by recursively defining concepts using examples and classify a new image by collecting evidence from these examples. Result of FEDGE will also be given in this paper.

**Tasks:** 

1. Implement the full algorithm as given in the paper.
2. At the end of the paper they have given 2 sets of example filters use both of them and try the algorithm on different images and save the results
3. A detailed technical report of the work
