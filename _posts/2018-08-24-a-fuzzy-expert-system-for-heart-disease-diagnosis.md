The aim of this study is to design a Fuzzy Expert System for heart disease diagnosis. The designed system based on the V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation data base. The system has 13 input fields and one output field. Input fields are chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, resting blood sugar, maximum heart rate, resting electrocardiography (ECG), exercise, old peak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest), thallium scan, sex and age. The output field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4 (distinguish presence (values 1, 2, 3, 4)). This system uses Mamdani inference method. The results obtained from designed system are compared with the data in upon database and observed results of designed system are correct in 94%.
