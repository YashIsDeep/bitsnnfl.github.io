**Abstract:** This paper introduces the Deep Recurrent Attentive Writer (DRAW) neural network architecture for image generation. DRAW networks combine a novel spatial attention mechanism that mimics the foveation of the human eye, with a sequential variational auto-encoding framework that allows for the iterative construction of complex images. The system substantially improves on the state of the art for generative models on MNIST, and, when trained on the Street View House Numbers dataset, it generates images that cannot be distinguished from real data with the naked eye.

1. Implement the architecture given in the paper using Keras with Tensorflow as backend.
2. Only to be implemented for MNIST dataset, CIFAR can be skipped.
3. Compare the results obtained with the given paper.
