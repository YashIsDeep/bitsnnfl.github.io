**Abstract:** We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks. We show that a simple CNN with little hyperparameter tuning and static vectors achieves excellent results on multiple benchmarks. Learning task-specific vectors through fine-tuning offers further gains in performance. We additionally propose a simple modification to the architecture to allow for the use of both task-specific and static vectors. The CNN models discussed herein improve upon the state of the art on 4 out of 7 tasks, which include sentiment analysis and question classification.

**Task:** Implement the core algorithm in python using Tensorflow, Pytorch, MXNet or NumPy. The submitted code would be checked for similarity with the implementations available online. Use [StackOverflow Dataset](https://github.com/jacoxu/StackOverflow) to benchmark performance.
