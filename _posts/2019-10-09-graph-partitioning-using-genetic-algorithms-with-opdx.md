**Abstract:** In this paper, we will study approximate solutions to the extension of the Maximally Balanced Connected Partition Problem, whose corresponding decision problem is known to be NP-complete. We will introduce a genetic algorithm with a new crossover operator and we will compare the results of our algorithm to a well known deterministic approximation algorithm.

**ID:** 201

**Guidelines:**

1. Read through the paper, understand the problem statement and why it is NP-complete.
2. Implement an interface to view solutions of the partitioning problem.
3. Implement the genetic algorithm from scratch in Python.
4. Do a quantitative comparison of OPDX with atleast two other permutation operators, such as ordered crossover, cycle crossover or PMX.
