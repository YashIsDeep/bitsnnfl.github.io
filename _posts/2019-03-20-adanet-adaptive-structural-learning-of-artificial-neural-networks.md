**Abstract:** We present new algorithms for adaptively learning artificial neural networks. Our algorithms (ADANET) adaptively learn both the structure of the network and its weights. They are based on a solid theoretical analysis, including data-dependent generalization guarantees that we prove and discuss in detail. We report the results of large-scale experiments with one of our algorithms on several binary classification tasks extracted from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The results demonstrate that our algorithm can automatically learn network structures with very competitive performance accuracies when compared with those achieved for neural networks found by standard approaches.

**ID:** 11

**Restricted Frameworks:** TensorFlow

**Requirements:** 

1. Implement the AdaNet Algorithm (Fig 3. in the paper).
2. Test your AdaNet on CIFAR-10 as done in Section 6.1.
3. Modify the AdaNet algorithm to only select one candidate subnetwork: Section 5.2: Second Subnetwork. 
4. Perform experiments on the new network as done in 2.
5. Compare the results obtained in 2. and 4.
