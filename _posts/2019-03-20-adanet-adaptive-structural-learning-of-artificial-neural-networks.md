ID: 11

Restricted Frameworks: TensorFlow

Required: 1. Implement the AdaNet Algorithm (Fig 3. in the paper). 2. Test your AdaNet on CIFAR-10 as done in Section 6.1. 3. Modify the AdaNet algorithm to only select one candidate subnetwork: Section 5.2: Second Subnetwork. 4. Perform experiments on CIFAR-10 to compare with the results in 2.
