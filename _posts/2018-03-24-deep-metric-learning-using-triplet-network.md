**Abstract:** Deep learning has proven itself as a successful set of models for learning useful semantic representations of data. These, however, are mostly implicitly learned as part of a classification task. In this paper we propose the triplet network model, which aims to learn useful representations by distance comparisons. A similar model was defined by Wang et al. (2014), tailor made for learning a ranking for image information retrieval. Here we demonstrate using various datasets that our model learns a better representation than that of its immediate competitor, the Siamese network. We also discuss future possible usage as a framework for unsupervised learning.

**Task:** Implement the core algorithm in python using Tensorflow, Pytorch, MXNet or NumPy. The submitted code would be checked for similarity with the implementations available online. Train the network on MNIST and FashionMNIST.
