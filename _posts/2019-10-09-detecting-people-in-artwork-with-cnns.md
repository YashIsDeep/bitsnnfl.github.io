**Abstract:** CNNs have massively improved performance in object detection in photographs. However research into object detection in artwork remains limited. We show state-of-the-art performance on a challenging dataset,People-Art,  which  contains  people  from  photos,  cartoons  and 41  different artwork  movements.  We  achieve  this  high  performance  byfine-tuning a CNN for this task, thus also demonstrating that trainingCNNs on photos results in overfitting for photos: only the first three or four layers transfer from photos to artwork. Although the CNNâ€™s perfor-mance is the highest yet, it remains less than 60% AP, suggesting furtherwork is needed for the cross-depiction problem.

**ID:** 171

**Guidelines:**

1. Implement the full architecture.
2. Use CaffeNet  and VGG1024 for pretraining and fcompare their validation results.
3. Compare default, gap, all-neg, gap+all-neg, configuration for fine tuning for the above models and compare them.
