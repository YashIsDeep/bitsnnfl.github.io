The visual estimation of the rank of a matrix has eluded researchers across a myriad of disciplines many years. The rank of a matrix M reveals a great deal. By definition, it tells us how many linearly independent columns the matrix has; surprisingly, it also tells us how many linearly independent rows the matrix has, and if that does not get you excited, I do not know what will. If we think of M as an operator, the rank tells us about the dimensionality of its output, and thus for a square matrix, whether M is invertible.

In this paper, we demonstrate the successful visual estimation of a matrixâ€™s rank by treating it as a classification problem. When tested on a dataset of tens-of-thousands of colormapped matrices of varying ranks, we not only achieve state-of-the-art performance, but also distressingly high performance on an absolute basis.
