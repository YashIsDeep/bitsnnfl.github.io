This paper describes the design and development of a sensor based navigation system which makes it possible for a non-holonomous mobile robot to follow walls using information on its environment picked up by a belt of ultrasonic sensors. To control the robot no preliminary information regarding its environment is required, the robot adapts to them through the information gathered on the spot by the ultrasonic sensors and the information released >om a spatial memory. The controUer allows the generation of the signal to the robot 3 motors. It has been developed in two directions: one being based on the concept of general perception and the other on the concept of distributed perception, and in carrying out both of these lines of development, the principles of fuzzy logic have been applied.
