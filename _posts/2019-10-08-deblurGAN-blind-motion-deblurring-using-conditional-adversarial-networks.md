**Abstract:** We present DeblurGAN, an end-to-end learned method for motion deblurring. The learning is based on a conditional GAN and the content loss. DeblurGAN achieves state-of-the art performance both in the structural similarity measure and visual appearance. The quality of the deblurring model is also evaluated in a novel way on a real-world problem – object detection on (de-)blurred images. The method is 5 times faster than the closest competitor – Deep-Deblur. We also introduce a novel method for generating synthetic motion blurred images from sharp ones, allowing realistic dataset augmentation.

**Guidelines/Tasks:**

1. Implement the architecture given in the paper using Tensorflow. You may use tf.keras (for using pretrained models like MobileNetV2) but do not use Keras API (with tensorflow backend) directly.
2. Use MobileNetV2 as feature extractor rather than VGG19 as prescribed.
3. You can go ahead with any one of the following for dataset:
- GoPro_Large ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H0PIXvJH4c40pk7ou6nAwoxuR4Qh_Sa2/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H0PIXvJH4c40pk7ou6nAwoxuR4Qh_Sa2/view)): This is a very large dataset (~9GB) but best for training purpose. If you are not able to download it, you can take it from me directly.
- Kaggle Blur Dataset ([https://www.kaggle.com/kwentar/blur-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kwentar/blur-dataset)): This is a relatively much smaller dataset, so you may have to use image augmentation techniques. Note that you have to use motion blurred images and not defocussed blurred images from this dataset.
- Object Detection Dataset ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CPMBmRj-jBDO2ax4CxkBs9iczIFrs8VA/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CPMBmRj-jBDO2ax4CxkBs9iczIFrs8VA/view)): This is also a relatively much smaller dataset, so you may have to use image augmentation techniques.
- You can generate a dataset yourself by applying the motion blurring algorithm (specified in the paper) on your custom image dataset or writing a Python script to use an online tool (like [https://www5.lunapic.com/editor/?action=motion-blur](https://www5.lunapic.com/editor/?action=motion-blur)) for motion blurring.
Divide your dataset into train and validation sets.
4. As shown in the paper, show some demo examples generated by your trained model.
5. Calculate PSNR and SSIM metrics for your model on validation dataset. You may find skimage library useful for this purpose.
