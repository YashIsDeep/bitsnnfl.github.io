**Abstract:**Â  Document level sentiment classification remains a challenge: encoding the intrinsic relations between sentences in the semantic meaning of a document. To address this, we introduce a neural network model to learn vector-based document representation in a unified, bottom-up fashion. The model first learns sentence representation with convolutional neural network or long short-term memory. Afterwards, semantics of sentences and their relations are adaptively encoded in document representation with gated recurrent neural network. We conduct document level sentiment classification on four large-scale review datasets from IMDB and Yelp Dataset Challenge. Experimental results show that: (1) our neural model shows superior performances over several state-of-the-art algorithms; (2) gated recurrent neural network dramatically outperforms standard recurrent neural network in document modeling for sentiment classification.

**Task:** Implement the Conv-GRNN architecture in Python using Tensorflow, Pytorch, TheanoMXNet or NumPy. Train the network on IMDB dataset.

**Brownie Points:** Implement the LSTM-GRNN architecture.
