**Abstract:** We present the first deep learning model to successfully learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement learning. The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function estimating future rewards. We apply our method to seven Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment, with no adjustment of the architecture or learning algorithm. We find that it outperforms all previous approaches on six of the games and surpasses a human expert on three of them.

**Guidelines:**

This paper revolutionized the world of Reinforcement Learning
1. Implement the paper. The game environment can be different. Contact me before selecting the game.
2. Improve the learning rate and hyper parameter sensitivity.
