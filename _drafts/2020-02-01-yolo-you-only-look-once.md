The paper is straightforward. Implement the architecture as described in the paper using Keras/Tensorflow. Try training for limited images and of limited categories(say 5000 images for).

* Show quantitative tangibles such as Mean errors, etc.
* Try new things (say dropout) on your own for improving the results.
