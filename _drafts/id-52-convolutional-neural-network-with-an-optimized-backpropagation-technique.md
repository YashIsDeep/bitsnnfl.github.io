**Abstract:**

This paper exhibits an Object recognition technique using the Convolutional Neural Network in Deep Learning. Backpropagation is a redundantly used method to calculate the gradient of a curve. The gradient, in turn, is involved in the weight upgradation while training the deep neural network. Being a repeatedly rediscovered algorithm, Backpropagation still stands out to give better results with its various optimization techniques. An Object Recognition technique in deep learning using backpropagation, optimized with a heuristic optimization technique is implemented and evaluated.

**Tasks:**

1. Implement the model in Tensorflow. Specify the number of layers of each type for the CNN that you are implementing.
2. Only RMSPROP and Adadelta optimizer results need to be shown.
