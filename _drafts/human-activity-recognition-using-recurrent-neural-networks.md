**Short Introduction:** Human activity recognition using smart home sensors is one of the bases of ubiquitous computing in smart environments and a topic undergoing intense research in the field of ambient assisted living. The increasingly large amount of data sets calls for machine learning methods. In this paper, a deep learning model that learns to classify human activities without using any prior knowledge is used. For this purpose, a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network was applied.

**Paper:** [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07144.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07144.pdf "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07144.pdf")

**_Expected Deliverables:_**

1. The paper is easy to implement as the network is very simple.
2. Your accuracy and pre-processing for obtaining better accuracy also carry weightage for this particular paper. Please have proper understanding of pre-processing you apply to the data.
3. Try out different RNN unit than LSTM (**_example : Use GRU units_**) and report the results for the same.
4. Dataset : [OPPORTUNITY Activity Recognition Dataset.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/OPPORTUNITY+Activity+Recognition "Opportunity ") Get a proper understanding of the data, it's dimensions etc., go through the paper thoroughly.
5. **BONUS:** Extend your model to train on [PAMAP2 dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/pamap2+physical+activity+monitoring "PAMAP").
