**Short Introduction:** Human activity recognition using smart home sensors is one of the bases of ubiquitous computing in smart environments and a topic undergoing intense research in the field of ambient assisted living. The increasingly large amount of data sets calls for machine learning methods. In this paper, a deep learning model that learns to classify human activities without using any prior knowledge is used. For this purpose, a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network was applied.
