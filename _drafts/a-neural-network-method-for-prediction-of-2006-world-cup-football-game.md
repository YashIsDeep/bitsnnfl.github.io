A neural network method is adopted to predict the football game's  winning rate of two teams according to their previous stage's official  statistical data of 2006 World Cup Football Game. The adopted prediction  model is based on multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with back propagation  learning rule. The input data are transformed to the relative ratios  between two teams of each game. New training samples are added to the  training samples at the previous stages. By way of experimental results,  the determined neural network architecture for MLP is 8 inputs, 11  hidden nodes, and 1 output (8-11-1). The learning rate and momentum  coefficient are sequentially determined by experiments as well. Based on  the adopted MLP prediction method, the prediction accuracy can achieve  76.9% if the draw games are excluded.
