Deliverable: Implement the full network explained in fair detail in the paper. As usual, show the decrease in loss function with iterations.

Will ask then to demonstrate the decrease in loss on a small section of the dataset.

Dataset: MMI and/or FER2013. FER2013 is freely available on Kaggle and MMI needs an account to be downloaded. [https://mmifacedb.eu](https://mmifacedb.eu "https://mmifacedb.eu")
