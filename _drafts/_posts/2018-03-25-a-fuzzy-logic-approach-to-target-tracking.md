**Abstract:** This paper discusses a target tracking problem in which no dynamic mathematical model is explicitly assumed. A nonlinear filter based on the fuzzy If-then rules is developed. A comparison with a Kalman filter is made, and empirical results show that the performance of the fuzzy filter is better. Intensive simulations suggest that theoretical justification of the empirical results is possible.   

**Paper Link:** [https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1303/1303.5433.pdf](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1303/1303.5433.pdf "https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1303/1303.5433.pdf")

**Tasks:**

1. Use different fuzzification and defuzzification methods (more than 1)
2. In paper they compare results with Kalman filter approach, you can skip that just compare the trajectory of the fuzzy model with actual trajectory
3. Bonus points if you extend the problem in 3 dimensions 
4. A detailed technical report of the work
