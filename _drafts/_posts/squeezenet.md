**Abstract:** Clustering is central to many data-driven application domains and has been studied extensively in terms of distance functions and grouping algorithms. Relatively little work has focused on learning representations for clustering. In this paper, we propose Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC), a method that simultaneously learns feature representations and cluster assignments using deep neural networks. DEC learns a mapping from the data space to a lower-dimensional feature space in which it iteratively optimizes a clustering objective. Our experimental evaluations on image and text corpora show significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

**Task:** Implement the deep embedded clustering method described in the paper in python using TensorFlow, Pytorch or MXNet. Test your implementation on MNIST dataset.

**Brownie points:** Compare your result with AutoEncoder + K-means and try to get results similar to the one mentioned in the paper.
