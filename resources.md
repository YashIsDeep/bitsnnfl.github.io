### Blogs and Videos

1. http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ is an amazing place to start learning about neural networks. The website is in the form of a book. I would highly suggest you read the [first chapter](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html). 

2. CS231n is a course at Stanford previously taken by Andrej Karpathy. The videos are more than an hour-long, and the course is quite extensive and out-of-scope for those who are new to this field, but there are some lectures which I would recommend you to watch. You may go through them at 1.5x speed or however you like, the point is to go over it once. You are not expected to understand everything right from the start.

    - [CS231n Winter 2016: Lecture 4: Backpropagation, Neural Networks 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i94OvYb6noo&list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC&index=4), so you can have a good intuition of backpropagation
    - [CS231n Winter 2016: Lecture 7: Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxfUGhug-iQ&list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC&index=7) to realize how simple CNNs are
    - [CS231n Winter 2016: Lecture 8: Localization and Detection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxZrEKZfW2o&list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC&index=8), for those who want to know enough to be able to choose a good design project

3. [Jupyter Notebooks Tutorial](https://github.com/adityassrana/BITS-F312-Neural-Networks-and-Fuzzy-Logic), for those who are new to Jupyter Notebooks.
