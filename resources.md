### Blogs and Videos

1. http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ is an amazing place to start learning about neural networks. The website is in the form of a book. I would highly suggest you to read the [first chapter](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html). You may go through them at 1.5x speed or however you like, the point is to go over it once. You are not expected to understand everything right from the start.

2. CS231n - a course by Stanford. The videos are more than an hour long and the course is quite extensive and out-of-scope for those who are new to this field but there are 2 lectures which I would reccomend you to watch.
	- [CS231n Winter 2016: Lecture 4: Backpropagation, Neural Networks 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i94OvYb6noo&list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC&index=4), so you can have a good intuition of backpropagation
	- [CS231n Winter 2016: Lecture 7: Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxfUGhug-iQ&list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC&index=7)
	- [CS231n Winter 2016: Lecture 8: Localization and Detection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxZrEKZfW2o&list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC&index=8), for those who want to know enough to be able to choose a good design project.
