As a part of your evaluation for the course Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic, you are required to implement a research paper from scratch related to the topics discussed in the lectures. This portal contains the collection of 76 research papers compiled by the teaching assistants for the same.

**Details:**

* The projects are categorized according to the concepts required to implement them and tagged according to the difficulty level.
* The project page contains the guidelines that you **must strictly follow** while implementing the paper.
* In case of any doubts/discrepancies, please contact the concerned TA (whose details are mentioned on the project page) at the earliest.
* In some cases, it might happen that we change the TA assigned for a particular paper after the procedure of students selecting their research papers for implementation has ended.

**Evaluation Schedule:**

The tentative dates for the evaluation and presentation of the Design Projects will be around **15th November 2019** (i.e. third week of November), details of which will be communicated soon. **Please note that it will not be possible to extend this deadline whatsoever**.
