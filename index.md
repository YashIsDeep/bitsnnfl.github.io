As a part of your evaluation for the course Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic, you are required to implement a research paper from scratch related to the topics discussed in the lectures. This portal contains the collection of papers compiled by the teaching assistants for the same.

**Details:**

* The projects are categorized according to the concepts required to implement them and tagged according to the difficulty level.
* In case of any doubts, you can contact the concerned TA for a particular paper whose details are mentioned on the project page.
* The project page also contains the guidelines that you must strictly follow while implementing the paper.

**Allotment Procedure:**

* You need to work in groups of up to 3 people for the project.
* A google form will be floated on Tuesday at 8:30 PM (26th March, 2019), on which you will have to mention the name of your group members and the choice of paper for implementation. (Only one of the members in the group is required to fill the form)
* Each paper will be allotted to only ONE group and the allotment will be strictly on first come first serve basis. Consequently, it will be beneficial if you shortlist multiple papers from the list.
* On the form, you will be required to fill in up to 3 preferences for the paper you wish to implement.
* If you want to implement a paper which is not available in the list, you can suggest a paper in the designated space on the google form. Note that if you suggest a paper on your own, it will automatically be considered your highest preference.

**Note:** If you suggest a paper on your own, it will first be verified by us for code availability, good research and ease of implementation.

Changes, if any, to the procedure will be communicated to you before Tuesday.
